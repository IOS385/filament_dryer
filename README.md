# 3D Printer Filament Dryer Project

This project involves the development of a PCB designed to integrate the **Franzininho C0** with various interfaces for power, sensor reading, and load actuation.

## Key Features:
- Custom PCB to interface with **Franzininho C0**
- Power management for multiple components
- Sensor input reading (e.g., temperature, humidity)
- Load control for actuators and heating elements
- Suitable for drying filaments used in 3D printing

**Note:** This is a flexible project that can be used in other applications, such as:

- AC high-load actuation
- Relay control
- Display interface

The only limit is your creativity.
